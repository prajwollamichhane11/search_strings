Search_String is a simple C program that is used to search Strings.

So what kinds of strings does it search ?

Ans: This code is run on a certain directory and when it is compiled on that certain directory, this code is able to show the numbers of text files present on that directory and then it asks the user for string he/she wants to search in those shown text files. So, when the string to be searched is entered, it goes through the text files and prints the no. of times a string is repeated on different text files and the total number of times the string has come on the different text files.

#TODO 
1. Memory allocation is not properly handled so, DMA is to be implemented
2. This code works only for the text files while not for pdfs, docx and different other document files.
